# Color Blaster

This game was my first experience with programming in general.  I made it in Spring of 2011, while taking an Introduction to Programming class.  The class was in Java, but the first week we did Processing and I got hooked so I put this together.

To play it, just run it in processing.  I'll have a video of it running up really soon.

I have not edited the code of the game in any way, shape, or form since May of 2011.  In the interest of full disclosure, I did fix one or two typos in the comments, but that's it, I swear.
